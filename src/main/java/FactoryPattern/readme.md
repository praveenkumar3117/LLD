The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern used to create objects without specifying their exact class.
It provides a common interface for object creation while delegating the instantiation logic to subclasses or a dedicated factory class.



Why?
Encapsulation: Hides object creation logic from the client.
Scalability: Easily extendable when new object types need to be added.
Loose Coupling: The client code depends on an interface rather than concrete implementations.
