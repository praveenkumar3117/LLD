The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
Itâ€™s useful when you need to create multiple objects that should be used together.

Encapsulation: Hides object creation logic from the client.
Loose Coupling: Client depends on abstract interfaces, not concrete implementations.
Consistency: Ensures that related objects are created together (e.g., UI components for Windows vs. Mac).
